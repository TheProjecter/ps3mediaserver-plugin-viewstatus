# About the plugin #
This plugin can keep track of which files you have already seen. It does so by writing to a hidden file in the folder the media is in. This file is called .viewstatus (notice the dot in front). It is possible to add this file yourself containing allviewed=true to mark all files in the folder as viewed.

See the wiki for more information on how to install and use this plugin.

<font color='red'><b>At this time you will have to build your own copy of ps3mediaserver to use this plugin. This is because I developed a new type of plugin which is not yet supported by the current build of ps3mediaserver. Let's hope the developers see it's potential ;)</b></font>
