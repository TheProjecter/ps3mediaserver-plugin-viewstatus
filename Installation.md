# Installation #

## Requirements ##
All you need is to have [ps3mediaserver](http://code.google.com/p/ps3mediaserver/) running. Note that, for now, you will need the svn version, so you can edit some main files. This is necessary because this plugin is based on a new plugintype I developed which is not in ps3mediaserver. Hopefully this will change. For now, please see the page ServerChanges for instructions.

## Install ##
All you need to do is download ViewStatus.jar from the Downloads Page. Then drop this file in the plugins folder of ps3mediaserver.

### Activate/Deactivate ###
The plugin is activated by default. You can disable the plugin in the options panel. To open the panel click on the 'View Status' button on the 'General Configuration' tab.
